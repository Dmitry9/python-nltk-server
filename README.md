To update the `latest` tag of your Docker image on Docker Hub, you can follow these general steps:

1. Build the new Docker image with the updated Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t dmitry9/flask-nltk-service:latest .
```

Make sure you are in the directory containing your updated Dockerfile when running this command.

2. Tag the newly built image with the `latest` tag.

```bash
docker tag dmitry9/flask-nltk-service:latest dmitry9/flask-nltk-service:latest
```

3. Push the updated image to Docker Hub.

```bash
docker push dmitry9/flask-nltk-service:latest
```

4. trigger url redeploy hook (see notes) for render.com

Now, your Docker Hub repository should be updated with the latest changes, and the `latest` tag should point to the new image.

Remember that using `latest` as a tag can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially in production environments, as it doesn't provide a clear version reference. It's often recommended to use versioned tags for more predictable deployments.
